I am a third-year undergraduate student at the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.scu.edu.cn/), **Sichuan University**, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I rank within **top 5%** of my cohort.

Currently, I am a research assistant at the **[DICA Lab](https://center.dicalab.cn/)** (Engineering Research Center of Machine Learning and Industry Intelligence Application, Ministry of Education), advised by [**Prof. Hongliang Guo**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=vR9kUw8AAAAJ). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**, **Risk-Sensitive RL**, and **Robotics** (Navigation & SLAM). I am particularly interested in developing reliable and efficient algorithms for multi-robot collaboration in structured environments.

You can find my CV here: [**Curriculum Vitae**](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
