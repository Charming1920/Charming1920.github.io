## Project Description

Addressing the limitation of traditional parking search algorithms that ignore search uncertainty, I proposed the MS-PPO (Mean-Standard Deviation Proximal Policy Optimization) algorithm and built a complete autonomous parking system.

### Theoretical and Algorithmic Innovation

- Derived the second-order Bellman equation and dual-objective policy gradient theorem

- Proposed a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning framework

### Strategy Optimization Implementation

- Designed a modular architecture including MS-TD and MS-PG components
- Introduced Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to balance dual optimization of mean and variance
- Achieved "stable yet efficient" search strategies in various complex topological road networks

### Full-Stack System Deployment

- Built an autonomous driving experimental platform based on a golf cart
- Achieved full-process autonomous planning and parking in real underground garages
- Completed end-to-end validation from algorithm to real vehicle deployment
